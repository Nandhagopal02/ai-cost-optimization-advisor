# 🤖 AI Cost Optimization Advisor

### 🚀 Project by Nandhagopal

AI Cost Optimization Advisor is an intelligent Lyzr AI agent built to help enterprises **reduce the cost of Generative AI (GenAI)** usage. The advisor recommends cost-effective LLMs, estimates token-based usage costs, optimizes prompt length, and identifies tasks that can be automated to save time and money.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

As enterprises increasingly integrate GenAI into daily operations, costs associated with LLM usage (e.g., OpenAI API charges, token overuse, premium models) are rising. Many teams overuse high-cost models or run inefficient prompts without monitoring.

This tool solves the problem by offering:
- Smart model selection (Claude, GPT, Mistral, etc.)
- Prompt efficiency suggestions
- Cost estimation based on usage
- Automation opportunity insights

---

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to:
- Help companies **reduce GenAI costs**
- Recommend the **most efficient LLM** per use case
- **Optimize prompt usage** to reduce token costs
- Estimate **monthly GenAI usage expenses**
- Suggest areas where **AI can replace manual work**

---

## 🛠️ Built With

This project is built entirely using **Lyzr AI** – no external libraries required.

Lyzr AI handles:
- ✅ LLM integration (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini)
- ✅ Prompt optimization
- ✅ Usage cost estimation
- ✅ Model comparison
- ✅ Automation suggestions

## 📌 Features

- 📉 Token usage & monthly cost estimation
- ✍️ Prompt rewriting for cost reduction
- 🔍 Model selection (Claude, GPT, Mistral)
- 🧠 Automation advisory for business functions
- 📊 Agent output in clear, structured format

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User enters their usage details (tokens, frequency, model used)
2. Agent estimates current and projected cost
3. Recommends cheaper LLMs if available
4. Optimizes prompts to reduce tokens
5. Suggests automation opportunities in areas like:
   - Customer Support
   - HR onboarding
   - Internal knowledge tasks
